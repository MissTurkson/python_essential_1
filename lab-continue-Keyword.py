#Your task here is very special: you must design a vowel eater! Write a program that uses:

#a for loop;
#the concept of conditional execution (if-elif-else)
#the continue statement.
#Your program must:

#ask the user to enter a word;
#use user_word = user_word.upper() to convert the word entered by the user to upper case; we'll talk about string methods and the upper() method very soon â€“ don't worry;
#use conditional execution and the continue statement to "eat" the following vowels A, E, I, O, U from the inputted word;
#print the uneaten letters to the screen, each one of them on a separate line.
#ugly vowel eater

lettersToPrint = ""
userInput = input("Enter a word: ")
userInput = userInput.upper()
for letter in userInput:
    if letter == "A":
        continue
    elif letter == "E":
        continue
    elif letter == "I":
        continue
    elif letter == "O":
        continue
    elif letter == "U":
        continue
    else:
        print(letter)
        # lettersToPrint += letter
# print(lettersToPrint, end="\n")
